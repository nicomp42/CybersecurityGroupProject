# CybersecurityGroupProject

A modularized project that facilitates group projects. Herein we learn how to work and play well with others. 
Each group gets a class to implement. The class (Step<NN>) has an Encrypt and Decrypt method.
The main method is a test rig that exercises all the Encrypt/Decrypt methods to see if the group implemented and committed properly.
